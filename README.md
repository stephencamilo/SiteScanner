* Run `composer install`
* On *CancerScanner.php* and *SelectorFinder.php* Files fill `basic_auth_user` and `basic_auth_pass` accordingly
* It is necessary to run *CancerScanner.php* first because user the path map generated by this file.
* On *SelectorFinder.php* File fill `css_selector` with the element you want to track sitewide
